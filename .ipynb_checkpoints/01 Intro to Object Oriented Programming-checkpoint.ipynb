    "# Intro to Object Oriented Programming\n",

    "\n",
    "## What are Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Computer Science (CS):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method; therefore, a location in memory having a value that can be referenced by an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Object Oriented Programming (OOP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to an object as in CS, an object in OOP is an **instance of a class** where this object can be either a variable, a function, a data structure or a combination of such.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Oriented Programming Paradigm (OOP Paradigm)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a programming paradigm that practices the following beliefs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming practice to design modular reusable software systems\n",
    "- OOP designs programs with creation of Objects\n",
    "- An approach that focuses on the definition of data rather than the input → processing → output logic (OOP vs procedure-oriented programming)\n",
    "- The goal is to create an object that we can define and provide functionality to solve problems\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Procedural vs OOP and analyzing Humans as 'objects' for CS\n",
    "\n",
    "A human may procedurally require:\n",
    "-- Calculations\n",
    "-- Logical Evaluations\n",
    "-- Complete Repetitive tasks\n",
    "-- Database\n",
    "\n",
    "A human as an object requires:\n",
    "-- What’s their name\n",
    "-- What’s their address\n",
    "-- What functions/methods can this object have?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of data and functional code. This is because real-world objects have states and behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```RECALL THAT AN OBJECT IS AN INSTANCE```**\n",
    "\n",
    "- States: The characteristic, Measurable data of an object\n",
    "- Behaviour: The available functionality of the object (what can it do?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions:**\n",
    "- Object’s Data → called: attributes\n",
    "- Object’s Code+Functionality → called: methods\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: List is an Object built into Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- List has characteristics/attributes\n",
    "    - We use square brackets to denote them, and they are a container of data\n",
    "    - It can be empty\n",
    "    - It can contain many items until we run out of system resources\n",
    "- List has methods\n",
    "    - We can print it\n",
    "    - We can use built-in functions on it: (len, max, min, str)\n",
    "    - We can convert it to other objects: (tuples)\n",
    "    - We can use membership operators\n",
    "    - We can use + and * operators\n",
    "    - We can mutate it (append, delete, modify values)\n",
    "    - We can iterate, index, and slice through it\n",
    "    - We can sort it\n",
    "\n",
    "This object was built into Python natively so that we can _implement the List Object_ in our code by creating **instances** of it."
