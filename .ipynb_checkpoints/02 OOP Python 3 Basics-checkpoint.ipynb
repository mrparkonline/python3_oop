    "# Basics of OOP with Python 3\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To create usable object in Python 3, we must create a _classification_ of it which defines what this object's attributes and methods are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Object Creation Recipe in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classify the object\n",
    "2. State its initialization of attributes\n",
    "3. State its available methods\n",
    "4. State how it should be printed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classifying the Object: Keyword: _class_\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like **def** for function definition, we have **class** to classify what our object is.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    # Insert your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "# end of ClassName  \n",
    "\n",
    "# To create an instance:\n",
    "random_variable = ClassName()\n",
    "print(random_variable) # if ClassName() object was printable then it would print a message.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initializing Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us set attributes to an object, we must utilize and modify a **built-in** initialization method available when constructing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows the following format:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def __init__(self, optional_arg1, optional_arg2, ...): # init is surrounded by 2 underscores before and after\n",
    "    # Attributes are stated here\n",
    "\n",
    "# end of __init__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- The **\\_\\_init\\_\\_** method is runs automatically when an object is instantiated; therefore, we declare our class attributes here\n",
    "- **self** is a keyword built-in to python for **OOP**; it allows us to refer to the class itself when we are coding inside our object\n",
    "- Any methods that are surrounded by two underscores (\\_\\_) are called _magic methods_ in python reserved mainly for OOP; and we will talk more about them in a later lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "## Giving our Object Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods give object functionality, interaction, and the ability to work with its attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "_When defining our methods, the first argument has to be **self** to denote that it is an attribute that belongs to the class. Other than this requirement, it is the exact same as creating a **function.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \n",
    "def methodName(self, optional_arg1, optional_arg2, ...)\n",
    "    # method codes are written here\n",
    "\n",
    "    return None # we can return a value if we'd like. Optional; dependent on the method\n",
    "    # for example list.sort() doesn't return anything.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# end of className\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object interaction with _$print()$_\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like how we used a magic method for \\_\\_init()\\_\\_, there is a magic method that help to make our object printable. **Without this step**, our object will just output its memory location when printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   \n",
    "def __str__(self): # This helps us make our object printable\n",
    "    return '' # we must return a string\n",
    "    \n",
    "# end of className\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Definition Format\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of our current knowledge together, we get this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, optional_arg1, optional_arg2, ...): # init is surrounded by 2 underscores before and after\n",
    "        # Attributes are stated here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # end of __init__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def methodName(self, optional_arg1, optional_arg2, ...)\n",
    "        # method codes are written here\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return None # we can return a value if we'd like.\n",
    "    # end of methodName\n",
